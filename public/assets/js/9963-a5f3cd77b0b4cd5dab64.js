The SEC oversees the purchase and sale of any asset that it considers to be a \u201csecurity\u201d.  The SEC is, at its core, a consumer protection agency that requires sales to US parties of investment assets that are securities to be regulated in a way that protects the public.

The SEC must apply this test to determine if a cryptocurrency, or any other digital asset, is a security.",CREATOR_COIN_REGULATORY_QUESTION3:"Are Creator Coin securities under the Howey Test?",CREATOR_COIN_REGULATORY_ANSWER3:"No, it is not anticipated that Creator Coin would be deemed securities under the Howey Test. Specifically, they are not bought with an expectation of profit, nor are they designed or marketed to create an expectation of profit, and fans are not passively waiting for any third party to create such profit - fans are incentivized to use Creator Coin to actively engage in their favorite creator\u2019s community, and to receive the exclusive benefits offered only to users of the coin.  In addition, fan and creator transactions, participation and activity using Creator Coin within the creator\u2019s economy are what power the economy, and not solely the efforts of any single party.

But more importantly, the Rally Network was never destined to fall into the high risk areas of securities and speculation.  Specifically, the Rally Network was designed with the core mission to harness the power of blockchain technology to solve a real world problem for digital content creators.  The promise of enabling secure, verifiable peer-to-peer transactions, in the context of fan-to-creator and fan-to-fan transactions made possible only in the digital space, is a perfect use case for the promise of blockchain technology.",CREATOR_COIN_REGULATORY_QUESTION5:"Are Creator Coin intended to be investments?",CREATOR_COIN_REGULATORY_ANSWER5:"No, the value of Creator Coin is not in their investment potential, and fans and followers of creators buy them for very different purposes.

Algorithmically determined fluctuation in price enables creators and their communities to build up a creator economy in the early stages and provide automated liquidity without having to trust a counterparty on the internet. Rally\u2019s technology enables the price to reflect market forces using a programmatic supply/demand curve - these curves are financial instruments called token bonding curves (TBCs). No central platform or person decides how a Creator Coin\u2019s price will change, once it is launched - it all occurs programmatically in a smart contract. These curves assign a Creator Coin value in $RLY, the governance token that enables community governance over the Rally Network.  Creator Coin value is algorithmically determined by TBCs based on the total supply of the coin - the less coins that exist and are used, the less $RLY is required to mint a new coin. By contrast, the more coins that exist, the more $RLY is needed to mint a new coin.",CREATOR_COIN_REGULATORY_QUESTION9:"Can the Rally Network be trusted?",CREATOR_COIN_REGULATORY_ANSWER9:"All creators and fans interested in learning more about the Rally Network will need to make their own assessment of the project and its goals.

The Rally Network assists with powering the technology behind Creator Coin, and enables creators to launch their coin on the blockchain.

If you own multiple Creator Coins, you will need to go to each Creator Coin page to see that amount. ",ANSWER14:"Yes - the pending rewards amount at the time of the rewards distribution will be the amount that gets deposited in your account. ",ANSWER15:"No - the underlying calculation of how network rewards work is still looking at the current amount of $RLY backing a Creator Coin against the average $RLY backing over the last 4 weeks. It is not about the percentage growth but the volume of coin growth week over week. ",ANSWER16:"Rewards are calculated by looking at the amount of a particular coin you own on an hourly basis over a weekly period. For every hour of that week, you are accumulating credit and the amount can vary if you purchase more coins, sell some coins, etc. At the end of the week, that accumulated amount is then totaled up and distributed among coin holders.
